Create a code cell for each step:\n\nStep 1: Extract the reviews in a list\n\nThe reviews are saved in the column review_text of the DataFrame df. Extract all reviews in a list combined_reviews.\n\nStep 2: Examine the reviews\n\nUse OpenAI\u2019s gpt-4.1-mini model to summarize the content in the reviews. The goal is to output a summary of product and service issues. To call gpt, assume the OPENAI_API_KEY is defined in .env, and use python-dotenv to load it. Use this prompt:\n\n\"\"\" You are analyzing customer reviews to identify product and service issues.\n\nBelow are customer reviews for a set of products. Please analyze them and provide:\n\nCommon Product Issues: List the main problems customers reported about the product itself (quality, functionality, features, etc.)\nCommon Service Issues: List the main problems customers reported about the service (shipping, customer support, packaging, etc.)\nFrequency: For each issue, estimate how often it appears (e.g., \"mentioned frequently\", \"occasional complaint\", \"rare issue\")\nFormat your response clearly with headers and bullet points.\n\nCUSTOMER REVIEWS: {combined_reviews}\n\n\"\"\"\n\nStep 3: Print & Save the summary\n\nPrint the summary and save it as a markdown file customer_reviews.md"
